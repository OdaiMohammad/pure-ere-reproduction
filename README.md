# PURE: Entity and Relation Extraction from Text system reproduction
This repo contains a reproduction of the authors' system as described in the research paper titled [A Frustratingly Easy Approach for Entity and Relation Extraction](). And it's based on the instructions available in the authors' [repository](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/PURE#pure-entity-and-relation-extraction-from-text). 

The goal is to reproduce the authors' results and experiments in a Jupiter notebook.
