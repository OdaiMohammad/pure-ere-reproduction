# PURE: Entity and Relation Extraction from Text system reproduction
This repo contains a reproduction of the authors' system as described in the research paper titled [A Frustratingly Easy Approach for Entity and Relation Extraction](). And it's based on the instructions available in the authors' [repository](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/PURE#pure-entity-and-relation-extraction-from-text). 

The goal is to reproduce the authors' results and experiments in a Jupiter notebook.

The reporduction is split into the following notebooks, to be run in this order as well:

1. *basic_setup.ipynb*: setup the environment by installing needed libraries and downloading the datasets.
2. *entity_setup.ipynb*: define the classes and functions needed to run the entity model.
3. *run_entity.ipynb*: run and evaluate the pre-trained entity model
4. *train_entity.ipynb*: train and evaluate the entity model from scratch
5. *run_relation.ipynb*: run and evaluate the pre-trained relation model
6. *train_relation.ipynb*: train and evaluate the relation model from scratch
